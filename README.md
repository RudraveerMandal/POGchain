POGchain works like any other blockchain, but it has a very light validating requirement which makes it possible for anyone to validate it. Validators can mint a POGcoin by validating enough transactions. This enables validation to be feeless. Read more in the [POGchain Validation Mechanism](https://github.com/storp-inc/POGchain/blob/master/pogcvm/pogcvm/readme.md).
It is written in C++14 and can be built and run on Linux, Mac OS and Windows. We recommend using the docker contanier provided.
